# Project Plan: LLM-Powered Post-Apocalyptic Text Adventure Game

## Project Overview

This project is a console-based, text-driven adventure game built in Python. The game is powered by an LLM (OpenAI) to generate dynamic storytelling and player interactions. It will feature a memory system to track player choices, recurring NPCs, puzzles, and a branching narrative that adapts based on user input. A simple database will be used to store game state, character progress, and key decisions.

## Core Components

1. Game Flow

The player begins by answering setup questions that define their character and preferences.

The LLM generates an opening scenario based on responses.

The game progresses in rounds, where the player makes decisions that affect the story.

The player can type freeform responses or select from predefined choices.

The LLM dynamically adjusts the narrative based on past choices and world state.

A key command system allows players to access inventory, past choices (journal), and other game-related information.

2. Game Setup & Character Creation

During the setup phase, the game prompts the player to define their character:

Name

Gender (Optional Selection)

Personality Traits (e.g., brave, cunning, resourceful, ruthless)

Background Role (e.g., scavenger, ex-soldier, scientist, nomad)

Story Length (Short, Medium, Long – determines the number of rounds)

These choices influence the initial setting, potential allies, and obstacles the player may encounter.

3. Story Progression & Rounds System

The game operates in rounds, each representing a major event, challenge, or choice.

The LLM generates events dynamically, considering past actions and stored memory.

Players interact with NPCs, solve puzzles, and make survival decisions.

Choices affect relationships, story branches, and available resources.

4. Recurring NPCs & Dynamic Interactions

NPCs remember past interactions and react accordingly.

Some NPCs may become allies, rivals, or enemies based on player choices.

NPC roles include:

The Mentor: A guide with valuable knowledge or secrets.

The Opportunist: A scavenger or trader with shifting loyalties.

The Rival: A competitor survivor or faction leader.

The Lost Soul: A character in need of help, potentially useful later.

The Wild Card: An unpredictable NPC who may help or hinder progress.

NPCs evolve dynamically, and their relationships with the player change as the story unfolds.

5. Memory & Database System

A lightweight database (SQLite or similar) will track:

Player choices and actions.

NPC relationships and status.

Inventory and resources.

Puzzle solutions (e.g., discovered codes, maps, etc.).

Story progression and key events.

This allows for continuity, NPC memory retention, and long-term consequences.

6. Puzzle System

The game includes various puzzles that require problem-solving and logic:

Locked Bunkers: Players must find access codes.

Radio Signals: Deciphering encrypted messages.

Environmental Hazards: Navigating storms, radiation zones, etc.

Negotiation Challenges: Convincing NPCs to help.

Resource Management: Deciding how to use limited supplies.

The LLM will generate hints based on player actions.

7. Key Commands & Player Interface

The player can use special key commands at any time:

"E" (Examine) – Displays inventory, journal entries, and past choices.

"I" (Inventory) – Lists all collected items and their uses.

"J" (Journal) – Summarizes major story events and decisions.

"M" (Map) – Displays known locations and objectives (if applicable).

These commands provide an easy reference without interrupting gameplay.

8. OpenAI LLM Integration

The LLM generates:

Story descriptions and world-building elements.

NPC dialogues and responses.

Adaptive narrative changes based on memory.

Puzzle hints when requested.

Dynamic epilogues summarizing the player's journey.

The model will use stored game data to ensure continuity in storytelling.

Technical Considerations

Programming & Architecture

Language: Python

Storage: SQLite or JSON for game state storage

LLM API: OpenAI API for text generation

Game Logic: Modular design for easy expansion and maintenance

Input Handling: Text-based commands with freeform interaction

Error Handling: Graceful handling of unexpected user input and API failures

Scalability & Expansion

Ability to expand the game world with more NPCs, factions, and locations.

Future integration of multiplayer elements or online persistence.

Possible UI enhancements for accessibility.

Next Steps

Implement the core game loop.

Develop the database system for memory storage.

Integrate OpenAI API for dynamic storytelling.

Design the NPC interaction system.

Create and test puzzles and decision-based events.
